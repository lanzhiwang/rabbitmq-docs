# Consumer Bias in RabbitMQ 3.3  RabbitMQ 3.3 中的消费者偏见

I warn you before we start: this is another wordy blog post about performance-ish changes in RabbitMQ 3.3. Still with us? Good.  在开始之前我警告你：这是另一篇关于 RabbitMQ 3.3 中性能变化的冗长博文。还和我们在一起吗？好的。

So in the [previous post](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2014/04/an-end-to-synchrony-performance-improvements-in-3-3/) I mentioned “a new feature which I’ll talk about in a future blog post”. That feature is consumer bias.  所以在上一篇文章中我提到了“我将在以后的博客文章中讨论的一个新功能”。这个特征就是消费者偏见。

Every queue in RabbitMQ is an Erlang process, and like all Erlang processes it responds to messages that are sent to it. These messages might represent AMQP messages being published to the queue, or basic.get requests coming in, or messages telling the queue that a consumer’s network connection is now no longer busy so it can receive messages again, and so on. It’s messages all the way down.  RabbitMQ 中的每个队列都是一个 Erlang 进程，并且像所有 Erlang 进程一样，它响应发送给它的消息。这些消息可能表示正在发布到队列的 AMQP 消息，或传入的 basic.get 请求，或告诉队列消费者的网络连接现在不再忙以便它可以再次接收消息的消息，等等。一直是消息。

When the queue is not busy, it just responds to messages as they come in. But as message rates go up, and the queue starts to work harder, we get to a state where the queue is using all the CPU cycles available to it. At this point, inbound messages start to queue up to be handled by the queue! [Flow control](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2012/04/rabbitmq-performance-measurements-part-1/) prevents them from building up indefinitely - but the fact that they are building up at all can have some consequences for the queue.  当队列不忙时，它只是在消息进入时对其进行响应。但是随着消息速率的上升，队列开始更加努力地工作，我们进入队列正在使用所有可用的 CPU 周期的状态。此时，入站消息开始排队等待队列处理！流量控制可以防止它们无限期地堆积——但它们正在堆积的事实可能会对队列产生一些影响。

Some of the inbound messages help the queue shrink (“this consumer can take messages again”, “I’d like to perform a basic.get”) while some make the queue grow (“I’d like to publish a new message”). So when the queue is working flat-out, we’d like to give preferential treatment to the messages that help the queue shrink, in order that the queue has a tendency to stay empty rather than grow forever.  一些入站消息帮助队列缩小（“这个消费者可以再次接收消息”，“我想执行一个 basic.get”），而一些使队列增长（“我想发布一条新消息” ）。因此，当队列完全工作时，我们希望优先处理有助于队列缩小的消息，以使队列倾向于保持为空而不是永远增长。

And we added such a bias in RabbitMQ 1.7.0.  我们在 RabbitMQ 1.7.0 中添加了这样的偏见。

So why am I talking about it now? That was five years ago!  那我为什么现在才说呢？那是五年前！

Unfortunately it turns out that just unconditionally preferring to empty the queue can have nasty side effects - in some circumstances it’s possible for the queue to spend 100% of its time delivering messages to consumers, and indeed we had some reports from users who saw exactly that - all consumers would go offline, the queue would build up to some huge size, then the consumers would come back and the queue would refuse to accept a single publish until it became completely empty. That’s not a very useful queue.  不幸的是，事实证明，只是无条件地倾向于清空队列可能会产生令人讨厌的副作用——在某些情况下，队列可能会花费 100% 的时间将消息传递给消费者，实际上我们收到了一些用户的报告，他们正是看到了这一点- 所有的消费者都会下线，队列会变得很大，然后消费者会回来，队列会拒绝接受单个发布，直到它完全为空。这不是一个非常有用的队列。

So we stripped out this bias in RabbitMQ 2.8.3, and went back to the situation where CPU-bound queues can tend to grow indefinitely.  因此，我们在 RabbitMQ 2.8.3 中消除了这种偏见，并回到了 CPU 绑定队列可能会无限增长的情况。

But we still wanted to do better than that. And in 3.3.0 we were finally able to.  但我们仍然希望做得更好。在 3.3.0 中，我们终于能够做到。

Now, rather than having queues unconditionally prefer to shrink, the queues are able to continuously monitor their rate of change in size, and when busy they will prioritise messages that help them to shrink - but only until they are delivering 10% more messages than they accept. So CPU-bound queues will still always accept messages, but will tend over time to become smaller rather than larger. Phew!  现在，与其让队列无条件地倾向于缩小，队列能够持续监控它们的大小变化率，并且在忙碌时，它们会优先处理有助于它们缩小的消息 - 但直到它们传递的消息比它们多 10%接受。因此，受 CPU 限制的队列仍将始终接受消息，但会随着时间的推移变得更小而不是更大。呸！
